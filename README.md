## ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!

My name is May (short for Maisha) and I'm an undergraduate CS and Math student at Rutgers University. I'm currently working part-time at Colgate-Palmolive as a Software Development Intern, and joining Jane Street this summer (2025) as a Software Engineering Fellow. Most of my personal and professional work involves designing, developing, and contributing to full-stack applications.

Some facts about me: I love weightlifting, origami, and watching Studio Ghibli movies. I also have a twin brother!

Reach me anytime at maishatakahashi@gmail.com.
